Easily feature the text of any Bible translation on your blog, personal website, or church website.

== Description ==
The Biblica® Bible Reader plugin is a free resource created to make
it easy to feature the text of any Bible on your blog, personal
website, or church website.

Designed for easy installation on virtually any blog or website, the
Biblica® Bible Reader plugin lets you supercharge your site with the
same powerful Bible reader that Biblica® uses on its own website,
Biblica.com. Biblica®, The International Bible Society, creators of
the New International Version (NIV), has subscribed to the
philosophy of Radical Generosity. As we translate new Bibles,
wherever possible, we are releasing them under Creative Commons
licensing, which makes them available at no charge to anyone who
wants or needs them, for any purpose. As we create new software,
we are committed to releasing it as Open Source, again free of
charge, for any purpose.

The Biblica® Bible Reader plugin uses API.Bible to access the text of
over 3,000 Bible translations. This way, you do not have to store
Bible text on your website, and the text that is delivered is always
the most current version available. To include the Biblica® Bible Reader
plugin on your website, download it from here, load it into
your WordPress instance, and register for an account at API.Bible
(https://scripture.api.bible). Every Bible translation has different
rules regarding licensing, and those are explained at API.Bible.

We pray that you will find this plugin useful and that it will help
advance your ministry.
